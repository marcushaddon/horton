TEXT SIZE    THE EDITORS  7:00 AM ET   2016 ELECTION  04:10 PM MATT FORDLINK The Republican candidates are mostly focused on strategically preventing Trump from amassing an outright majority of delegates before the convention. But on the Democratic side, it's still a slugfest for who can take home the biggest haul. Here's a look at the delegate math for Clinton and Sanders in both of tonight's primaries:  ​Michigan​: With 147 delegates at stake, Michigan's primary is one of the most important contests yet for Clinton and Sanders. But the state's dual-track system for allocating delegates will likely prevent either candidate from taking home an overwhelming share of them. Only 45 delegates are awarded based on the statewide vote. (There's a 15 percent viability threshold, but the two-candidate race makes it effectively irrelevant.) The remaining 85 delegates are awarded from within each of Michigan's fourteen congressional districts, with between five and nine delegates up for grabs in each district.  Because the district-based delegates are also allocated proportionally, Clinton and Sanders need to maximize their margins in the districts where they do best while staying competitive in the districts where they don't. The two key districts to watch tonight are Michigan's 13th and 14th congressional districts, which encompass most of Detroit and are worth nine delegates apiece. The beleaguered city of Flint, which hosted a Democratic debate on Sunday, is located in the state's 5th congressional district.​  Mississippi: A two-track delegate system also complicates how tonight's primary will award Mississippi's 36 delegates. Only 13 delegates are proportionally allocated by the statewide total. The remaining 23 delegates are unevenly divided among the state's four congressional districts. The 1st, 3rd, and 4th district offer four or five delegates each. But in the 2nd district, which encompasses Jackson and the surrounding areas, nine delegates are at stake. That's good news for Clinton. Her commanding majorities throughout the South so far—77 percent in Alabama, 71 percent in Georgia and Louisiana, and 64 percent in Virginia—helped her build a substantial delegate lead over Sanders nationwide. Those victories hinged on the overwhelming support of black voters, who make up about two-thirds of the 2nd district's population. Recent polls show Clinton on track to win a similar victory overall in Mississippi tonight. But Sanders could soften the delegate blow if he avoids dropping below the 15 percent viability threshold in all four congressional districts.  03:59 PM NORA KELLYLINK Looks like Donald Trump has learned his lesson about insulting a primary state's signature crop. KTVB, a Boise NBC affiliate, spoke with the mogul this morning, and he previewed what his message to Idaho voters will be if he takes the state. “I'll never forget you,” Trump said. “And I'll continue to eat your potatoes—which I'll do anyway because they're the greatest in the world—and we're going to make sure we protect that.” It's not just potatoes getting love from Trump as he tries to snag four states today: ​The Wall Street Journal ​notes that he's similarly fond of Hawaii's hotels and Michigan's cars. It's less clear, however, precisely what he adores about Mississippi.  03:21 PM VANN NEWKIRKLINK As Yoni noted, some people in Mississippi are reporting “slow” turnout at the polls. That’s hardly enough to make a prediction, but it is worth noting that this year we are getting our first glimpse of presidential primaries and elections with state voter-ID laws passed since a 2013 Supreme Court decision struck down preclearance on all elections decisions for states with a history of discrimination. Mississippi is one of those states.  As my colleague Brentin Mock wrote, several states are having their first presidential elections with new voter-ID laws after the fall of preclearance. Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia all debuted new ID laws on Super Tuesday, and some voters in February’s local elections in Wisconsin reported problems that might resurface in the state’s April primaries. As early voting in North Carolina is already underway for its March 15 primaries, voters must grapple with a maze of changes that mandate ID but offer some alternate pathways for voters with “reasonable impediments.”  Some voter-ID laws are still under judicial review and some other voting changes, such as North Carolina’s removal of same-day voting, have not yet been implemented, so it’s difficult to make any inferences on the basis of the primary elections, and difficult to assess the impact of these changes. Primary turnout might have limited utility in predicting general-election turnout, anyways. But grassroots organizers and campaign teams can see now if any voter-ID-related cracks are emerging in their registration efforts.  02:19 PM YONI APPELBAUMLINK There are 1,849,079 active registered votes in Mississippi, but only a small fraction of them will head to the polls in Tuesday’s election. In 2012, 294,112 voters cast ballots in the Republican primary—and just 97,304 in the uncontested Democratic race. (There were other races down the ballot that year to draw them to the polls.)  There are some indications that turnout will be higher this year. As of Monday night, voters requested 21,195 absentee ballots, according to Anna Moak, a staff attorney in the Mississippi secretary of state’s office. That’s up more than 50 percent from the 2012 primary, when just 13,920 were requested.  On the other hand, anecdotal evidence filtering in from around the state don’t report the same long lines or unusual turnout that primary elections have drawn in other states this year. The Jackson Clarion Ledger checked in with three polling places, where workers described turnout as “steady,” “light to medium,” and “slow.” In three coastal counties, the SunHerald reports, county clerks were more encouraged, calling turnout “good” in the morning before it “slowed down,” “fair,” and “strong.” In Greenville, according to the Delta Democrat-Times, it’s been “slim.” It was the same story in the Pine Belt, where the Hattiesburg American quoted one official describing turnout as light, while another said, “It's steady, but not what we expected.t win Michigan, it will be that much harder for his campaign to argue that he still has a viable path to the presidential nomination.  09:50 AM PRISCILLA ALVAREZLINK John Kasich has a lot riding on Michigan today. The Ohio governor has frequently visited the state in the last few weeks. According to the Detroit Free Press, he is the Republican presidential candidate who has spent the most time in the state.  His hope? That Michigan can give him a leg up going into the Ohio primary on March 15. Polls in Michigan show Kasich trailing behind Donald Trump, and in a tight race for second against Ted Cruz. But much relies on voter turnout, which has dropped significantly in primary elections, from 47 percent in 1972 to 21 percent in 2008. Here, Trump may have an advantage, if he succeeds at mobilizing voters as he’s appeared to have done in other states.  Whatever the outcome, Kasich has pledged to stay in the race until Ohio. “Do I want to do well in Michigan? Of course I do,” he said this past week. “I’m going to Ohio, O.K.? Let’s not be confused. And I’m going to win Ohio. End of story.”  07:44 AM YONI APPELBAUMLINK The polls are now open in Michigan, and will open in Mississippi in another thirty minutes. Both states are holding both Republican and Democratic presidential primaries on Tuesday. Voting in both states ends at the same time—7 p.m. central in Mississippi, and 8 p.m. eastern in the Wolverine state.  Voting in Idaho runs from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time—which is to say, until 11 p.m. eastern. Tuesday’s final contest is the Republican caucus in Hawaii, which also ends at 8 p.m.—but that’ll be 1 a.m. on Wednesday on the east coast of the United States.  Michigan offers the biggest cache of delegates in both races. In theory, the rust-belt state offers Bernie Sanders an unusually good shot at adding a big state to his column, but polling has shown consistent leads for Hillary Clinton. On the Republican side, Donald Trump has been polling strongly—but polls overstated his support in Saturday’s contests. Ted Cruz surged into second nationally on the strength of his support in Southern states, but this is less-favorable terrain for the staunch conservative. He’s locked in a tight battle with John Kasich, governor of the adjacent state of Ohio. Marco Rubio trails in a distant fourth; polls suggest he may not garner the 15 percent support necessary to win some of the state’s 59 delegates. There hasn’t been much polling in Mississippi, but one poll taken in recent weeks shows a huge Trump lead, with the other three candidates all struggling to clear the 15 percent threshold.  Welcome to another (slightly less) Super Tuesday in 2016, as Republicans head to the polls in four states and Democrats in two.  The big prize for each party is the Michigan primary, which will test the strength of front-runners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Most recent polls have given Trump a double-digit lead in a state where his criticism of trade deals should play well. But polls in some states have tended to overstate Trump’s advantage—most recently in Louisiana, where a surge of support for Ted Cruz on Saturday nearly closed a 24-point gap in early voting. In Michigan, Trump’s biggest threat may be John Kasich, the governor of nearby Ohio who could be making his final stand over the next week leading into the Buckeye State’s primary on March 15.  Surveys show Marco Rubio struggling in Michigan while Ted Cruz hopes to narrow Trump’s delegate lead. Republicans will be battling for a total of 150 delegates on Tuesday in Mississippi and Idaho primaries and a caucus in Idaho. The contests are merely a prelude, however, to what is expected to be a turning point in the race next Tuesday, when Kasich and Rubio try to win their home states of Ohio and Florida or face withdrawing from the race. If Trump holds them off, the 1,237 delegates he needs to win the nomination will become nearly attainable.  On the Democratic side, polls show Clinton holding what should be a comfortable lead over Bernie Sanders in Michigan despite the Vermont senator’s attacks on her past support for trade agreements like NAFTA. The two Democrats engaged in a feisty debate Sunday in Flint, during which Clinton criticized Sanders for voting against auto-bailout legislation in 2008. She is expected to win by a wide margin in Mississippi, as she has throughout the South. Sanders has managed to win enough smaller states to hang around in the Democratic primary, but Clinton’s goal now is to build up an insurmountable delegate lead, and barring a surprise, the results tonight should help her continue on her way.  —Russell Berman  JUMP TO COMMENTS         LATEST VIDEO    What It's Like to Leave Iraq for a Life in America  A young refugee who was shot and paralyzed during the U.S. invasion navigates a complex new life in California. Most Popular   Live Coverage of the Presidential Primaries THE EDITORS CONTINUE READING  The Republican Party Decides to Settle DAVID A. GRAHAM There was a time—long, long ago—when the Republican Party was afraid of Donald Trump, but it truly loathed Ted Cruz.  They hated him. They couldn’t stand him. They might have thought Trump was a huckster, they might have thought he didn’t have any idea what he was doing, and they might have thought he was a bigot, but at least he wasn’t as insufferable as Ted Cruz, the man who had gone out of his way to wreck the party’s plans in Congress, and had called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a liar. Forced to choose, party elders tended to shudder and lean Trump. Lindsey Graham was particular piquant in his criticism. He was very clear he didn’t like Cruz, who he said was no better than Trump and whom he accused of McCarthyism. He cracked, “If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.”  CONTINUE READING  Horace and Pete Is Louis C.K.'s Take on American Melodrama DAVID SIMS Louis C.K.’s new show Horace and Pete, available to view only on his website, is best experienced with as little foreknowledge as possible. Set in a 100-year-old bar in Brooklyn, its premise might initially seem familiar, and indeed this is a show where bartenders and customers trade jabs about their personal lives and the day’s goings-on like they’ve known each other for years. But it’s no sitcom. Horace and Pete is, in fact, an intense family melodrama that unfurls with all the blunt force of an Arthur Miller play. Though it perhaps has more in common with a different medium—theater—the series is one of the most innovative, invigorating pieces of television in years.  CONTINUE READING  Why Michigan Voters Are Hungry for Change RON FOURNIER DETROIT—A death in the family brought me home to Michigan last week and put me into a rental car, careening between potholes along a familiar stretch of I-75 populated by a diverse and anxious public struggling to choose a president.  Among them are friends and family, but also brief acquaintances—relationships forged over coffee and a reporter’s notebook.  People like David Kirby, a young entrepreneur from Brooklyn, who moved to Detroit three years ago as part of a wave of snake people seeking purpose and profit in the city’s revival. “I don’t have any connection to Old Detroit,” Kirby told me last fall, “the don’t-come-down-here-it’s-too-dangerous Detroit.”  Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders needs a huge turnout today among voters like Kirby: young, liberal, idealistic and—more often than not—white.  CONTINUE READING  All the Heels: Claire Underwood and the Case of the Perma-Stiletto MEGAN GARBER Allow me, for a moment, to ladysplain: No woman ever—no woman, at least, who has had any kind of say in the matter—has walked around her home in stilettos. No. Woman. Ever. Heels may lengthen the leg and swagger the walk and do all manner of aesthetically pleasing things to the lower limbs of the human body; they achieve all this, however, by creating in their wearer a step-by-step discomfort that builds, depending on the design of the shoe and the length of its wear, from the “very mild” to the “extremely torturous.” Which means that heels—and stilettos, in particular—are public shoes, performative shoes, shoes that are tolerated when one is out in the world and that are shed, immediately, upon one’s return from it. No woman ever—no, but really, No Woman Ever—has gotten home, looked down at her sky-high heels, and thought to herself, “Nah, I’ll just go ahead and keep them on.”  CONTINUE READING  Right-Hand Bias Is Everywhere NATALIE JACEWICZ As any left-handed person who’s ever struggled with a pair of scissors can attest, the physical world is largely built for righties, who comprise up to 90 percent of the population. But that imbalance also affects lefties in more subtle and profound ways than just unwieldy office supplies.  Daniel Casasanto, a psychologist at the University of Chicago, studies the ways in which the world is mentally biased toward the right. His research has shown that politicians, for example, tend to use their non-dominant hand for negative gestures, and parents in recent decades have shown a preference for baby names typed on the right side of the keyboard. Now, Casasanto is studying how handedness affects “approach motivation”—how we approach or avoid physical and social situations in the world around us.  CONTINUE READING  Netanyahu Snubs Obama One Last Time ADAM CHANDLER When future historians dissect the U.S.-Israeli relationship in the 21st century, it will be impossible not to remark on the cruelty of fate that placed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Barack Obama in each other’s paths for the majority of each other’s terms.  Ten years after being voted out, Netanyahu started his second premiership in late March of 2009, just two months after Obama took office. And while relations didn’t immediately devolve, when they did—over Iran’s nuclear program, Israel’s settlement policy, tactical differences in foreign policy, and beyond—they cratered hard.  The latest evidence comes in the form of a White House visit that Netanyahu was slated to make later this month while in town to speak at a conference for the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC. But the AP reported Monday night that Netanyahu had canceled his trip to Washington, D.C., and that the White House found out through the press.  CONTINUE READING  The 2016 U.S. Presidential Race: A Cheat Sheet DAVID A. GRAHAM It may not be Super Tuesday, or even Super Saturday, but don’t disrespect the March 8 primaries. With the Republican campaign in flux, today’s contests in Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho, and Hawaii may offer some sense of what to expect in the pivotal primaries a week away.  Donald Trump remains the man to beat in the GOP, but with Marco Rubio rapidly fading—his Sunday victory in Puerto Rico notwithstanding—Ted Cruz is gaining altitude. But how much, and how fast? It looks like Rubio’s attacks on Trump may have slightly dented the mogul, who did worse than expected on Saturday. But all the benefit seems to have ended up in Cruz’s camp, as the Texan gained voters, won Maine and Kansas, and made Louisiana extremely close.  CONTINUE READING  Tyrant-Proof the White House—Before It's Too Late CONOR FRIEDERSDORF An op-ed in Tuesday’s New York Times points out that, thanks to precedents set by President Obama, “whoever prevails in November will inherit a sweeping power to use lethal force against suspected terrorists and militants, including Americans.”  Let me put things more starkly: Under current precedent, the commander in chief can give a secret order to kill an American citizen with a drone strike without charges or trial.  Should Donald Trump have that power?  The ACLU’s Jameel Jaffer and Brett Max Kaufman don’t think so, and propose several specific reforms that would limit the next president’s ability to wage drone warfare. Obama should be transparent about the rules that govern drone strikes, “release the legal memos that purport to justify drone strikes away from battlefields,” and “make it the country’s default practice to acknowledge all drone strikes — not just those carried out on conventional battlefields, as in Iraq and Syria.”  CONTINUE READING  Free-Speech Advocates Are Not Trying to Silence Students CONOR FRIEDERSDORF Last week, I surveyed the overwhelming evidence that free speech is threatened on campus. But I did not address a counterargument that uncharitable skeptics of that position keep repeating: that those who defend liberal values in higher education are really trying to silence or distract from students who speak out against racism.  That is a pernicious falsehood every bit as bankrupt as the similarly uncharitable belief that all accusations of racism are really just cynical power grabs built on lies.  The falsehood is oft-repeated despite the fact that, across decades, many of the highest-profile opponents of campus speech restrictions, from the ACLU to Henry Louis Gates, have been energetic opponents of racism and outspoken defenders of minority rights. In November, when I defended my own work against the falsehood, I began noticing that it endures despite strong evidence that marginalized groups gain the most from norms that protect free expression and are harmed most grievously by limits on free speech, even when well-intentioned.
